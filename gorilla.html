                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>
                    Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as
                    laughter and sadness. In fact, gorillas share 98.3% of their genetic code with humans, 
                    making them our closest cousins after chimpanzees and bonobos. The largest of the great
                    apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like 
                    hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces. The two gorilla species live in equatorial
                    Africa, separated by about 560 miles of Congo Basin forest. Each has a lowland and upland
                    subspecies. Gorillas live in family groups of usually five to 10, but sometimes two to 
                    more than 50, led by a dominant adult male—or silverback—who holds his position for years.
                    The bond between the silverback and his females forms the basis of gorilla social life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another behavioural trait the gorillas display, is that they try to defend one another 
                    when faced with danger. The death of a one gorilla also has a tremendous effect on the 
                    others, especially when the dominant silverback dies the family group may be severely
                    disrupted.
                    The group may split into two or more smaller groups. When a new silverback takes over
                    a family group, he may kill all of the infants of the dead silverback. This is considered 
                    as an effective reproductive strategy since the new male conceives offspring that carry
                    on his genes. In most harmonious groups, there is no clear evidence of infanticide.

                <p>
                    Gorillas are very intelligent and can learn tremendously complex tasks. Some gorillas
                    have even been taught sign language by people and others have learned how to form simple
                    sentences and communicate with people.

                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
