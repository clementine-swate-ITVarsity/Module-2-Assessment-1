                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>
                    Giant panda, (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also called panda bear, bearlike mammal inhabiting
                    bamboo forests in the mountains of central China. Its striking coat of black and white,
                    combined with a bulky body and round face, gives it a captivating appearance that has
                    endeared it to people worldwide. Large males may attain 1.8 metres (6 feet) in length
                    and weigh more than 100 kg (220 pounds); females are usually smaller. Round black ears
                    and black eye patches stand out against a white face and neck. Black limbs, tail, legs,
                    and shoulders contrast with the white torso. The rear paws point inward, which gives 
                    pandas a waddling gait. Pandas can easily stand on their hind legs and are commonly 
                    observed somersaulting, rolling, and dust-bathing.
                </p>

                    Pandas are good at climbing trees and they can swim as well. Pandas are difficult to see
                    out in the wild as they live among the thick dense bamboo plants in old-growth forests
                    which is their favourite habitat. Pandas are very solitary creatures and will live alone
                    and will only meet other pandas during mating season. Giant panda bears are silent creatures
                    most of the time, however, they can bleat. Pandas do not roar like other bears, however, 
                    they do have 11 different calls, four of which are only used during mating

                    Pandas once lived in lowland areas, however, farming, forest clearing and other development
                    now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.

                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the panda at pen B36, right next to the pizza shop.</p>
