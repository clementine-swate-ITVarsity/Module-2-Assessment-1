                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>
                    Koalas can sleep for up to 20 hours a day, due to their low energy diet, and the 
                    intense amount of energy required to break down toxic leaves.
                    Koalas are mostly active at night (nocturnal) and around dawn and dusk. However, 
                    they can be seen moving during the day if they are disturbed, get too hot or cold,
                    or need to find a new tree. Koalas are solitary animals living within a network of
                    overlapping home ranges, which allows contact between individuals for mating.
                    Males will try to establish dominance over the home ranges of a number of females
                    during the mating season. These home ranges in southern and central Queensland vary
                    in size from 1km to 135km, depending on the density of the population and the 
                    abundance of suitable food trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Koalas are well-known for their large round head, big furry ears and big black nose.
                    Their fur is usually grey-brown in colour with white fur on the chest, inner arms, 
                    ears and bottom. They have no fur on their nose or the palms of their paws. Koalas have
                    particularly hard bottoms, which is similar to their closest relative, the wombat. For 
                    the koala, this feature enables them to wedge comfortably in tree forks for long periods
                    of time, whereas the wombat uses its hard bottom as a defence mechanism.
                    Koalas have poor vision and rely heavily on their other senses. They have excellent 
                    hearing which helps them detect predators and other koalas. They have an acute sense of
                    smell which also helps them detect other koalas and their favourite food trees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They often go unnoticed as they rest wedged in a tree fork, high in a gum tree. From the 
                    ground, a koala may appear to be little more than a bump on the tree itself.
                </p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the koala at pen A13, right next to the restaurant.</p>
