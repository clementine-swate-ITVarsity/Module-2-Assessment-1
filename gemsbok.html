                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>
                    Gemsboks stand around 4 feet 7 inches at shoulder height and weigh between 
                    230 – 250 kilograms (females weigh slightly less than males at around 
                    200 – 210 kilograms). Gemsboks coats are a light brown/grey color with lighter
                    patches to the bottom rear of their rump, and sandy grey flanks. A dark stripe extends
                    from their chin and travels down to the bottom of their neck, over their shoulder joints
                    and leg along their lower flanks and on each side of their rear legs. All four legs are 
                    black on their top half, with white below the knees and black patches on the shins.

                    Gemsbok have a horse-like posture and gallop and have muscular necks and shoulders. 
                    They have a long tail with black flowing hair.

                    Gemsboks are gregarious and sociable animals, spending time on open plains. Gemsboks can be
                    seen in herds of 10 or more individuals, however, when food is scarce, usually during the
                    dry season, they break up into smaller groups. After the rain season, gemsboks usually gather
                    into larger herds of up to 300 individuals. Herds are usually led by a territorial male who
                    marks his territory with piles of dung pellets to warn off male intruders. If intruders do 
                    come on to the territory duel conflicts usually occur involving horn clashing and body 
                    bashing. As calves in the herd grow, they test each other in what looks like games, but in 
                    reality are tests of strength. As the hierarchy becomes established, the need to fight is reduced.
                    Bachelor herds are rare.
