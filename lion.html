                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>
                    A male lion is 1.2m tall at the shoulders and has a mass of up to and over 200 Kg.
                    Female lions (lionesses) are slightly smaller and weigh about 130 Kg. Their
                    underparts are whitish with a general tawny to sandy tinge.
                    Rosettes and spots are characteristic of young animals and females often retain these
                    on their underparts. Only males have a long tawny mane on the sides of the face and on
                    top of the head. In some individuals this mane can become almost black. Lions prey 
                    mainly on large animals such as Zebra, Wildebeest, Buffalo, Gemsbok and even Giraffe. 
                    Smaller prey like Impala, Steenbok and even Porcupine are taken when the opportunity
                    arises. The task of hunting is often left to the lionesses of the pride, which hunt 
                    as a team.
                </p>

                    Another behavioural trait the gorillas display, is that they try to defend one another
                    when faced with danger. The death of a one gorilla also has a tremendous effect on the
                    others, especially when the dominant silverback dies the family group may be severely
                    disrupted.
                    The group may split into two or more smaller groups. When a new silverback takes over
                    a family group, he may kill all of the infants of the dead silverback. This is considered
                    as an effective reproductive strategy since the new male conceives offspring that carry
                    on his genes. In most harmonious groups, there is no clear evidence of infanticide.

                    African lions are found in Sub-Saharan Africa - this is the last refuge of these supreme
                    animals and South Africa offers some of the best opportunities to view lions in their 
                    natural habitat.

                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the lion at pen E25, right next to the coffee shop.</p>
