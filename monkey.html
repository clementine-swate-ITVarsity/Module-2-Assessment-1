                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>
                    Monkeys are a large and varied group of mammals of the primate order. They live
                    in trees, grasslands, forests, mountains and plains. They are seriously threatened
                    by habitat loss.

                    The term monkey includes all primates that do not belong to the categories human,
                    ape, or prosimian; however, monkeys do have certain common features. All are excellent
                    climbers, and most are primarily arboreal. Nearly all live in tropical or sub-tropical
                    climates. Unlike most of the prosimians, or lower primates, they are almost all 
                    day-active animals. Their faces are usually flat and rather human in appearance, their
                    eyes point forward, and they have stereoscopic color vision. Their hands and feet are 
                    highly developed for grasping; the big toes and, where present, the thumbs are opposable.
                    Nearly all have flat nails. Monkeys habitually sit in an erect posture.

                    Monkeys have their own complex language, using different sounds to identify different 
                    types of predators. They have been witnessed banging stones together to warn each other
                    of nearby predators. They also use facial expressions and body movements to communicate
                    with each other. Grinning, yawning, head bobbing, jerking the head and shoulders forward
                    or pulling the lip is usually a sign of aggression. Affection is expressed by grooming.

                    Some monkeys are monogamous, mating for life. They become distressed when separated. 
                    They express affection by holding hands, nuzzling, cuddling, grooming each other, 
                    intertwining their tails and lip smacking.

                    The pygmy marmoset is the smallest monkey in the world measuring less than six inches
                    and weighing only three to five ounces. The male mandrill is the world's largest monkey
                    at just over 3 feet long and weighing over 70 pounds.

                    Most monkeys eat both plants and animals. Some also eat dirt. Monkeys peel their bananas
                    like humans and do not eat the skins.

                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two large groups, or superfamilies, of monkeys: Old World monkeys 
                    (Cercopithecoidea) and New World monkeys (Ceboidea).
